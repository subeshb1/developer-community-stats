            It looks like you haven't order the JSON values in **ascending order alphabetically ignoring case** by Github user name or your JSON syntax is wrong. Please read the issue description before taking them.

            ```sh
              npx sort-json contributors.json --ignore-case
            ```

            **If you don't know about node js, go the following link:**
