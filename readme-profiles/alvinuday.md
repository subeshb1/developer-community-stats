Well for starters , Hi my name is Alvin 
I'm a first year student at Bits Pilani, Pilani 

My class 12th exams just got over some months ago
and i'm finally done with the JEE rat race.

I always had an interest in coding and technology (Basically the RANCHO of my house) **3 idiots reference here**
I know pyhton , c++,c and a bit of java. i mean most of the programming languages are similar except their syntax.

**I dont have many things to brag about# like big projects and all but...**
*7th AIR in computer science olympiad 
*state level badminton player
*i do have a knack for music ; i play guitar and keyboard 

and i'm hoping to add on further 
i love AI and Machine learning 
i just started with few simple datasets on kaggle 
hoping to get better at it 

I started GITHUB so that i could better interact with the tech community 
and most of all LEARN 

*PS: I'm still trying to get the hang of GITHUB markdown*
